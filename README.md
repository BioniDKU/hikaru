# BioniDKU Menus System (Hikaru-chan)
**The heart of [BioniDKU](https://github.com/Bionic-OSE/BioniDKU)'s end user experience.** On the surface, it provides instantly-accessible menus with configuration and personalization options for both the contestants and the host. Under the hood, it takes control over the Explorer shell as well as ensuring IDKU regulations stays enforced.

The project's codename, Hikaru, is taken from Microsoft Taiwan's [Silverlight mascot character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_Aizawa)<sup>1</sup>, with her little [cute signature hair bow](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/957762) being used as the executable icon found in release binary packages!

<sup>1. Though Silverlight has been discontinued, the team behind this character went split from Microsoft into a new company, developed a game in which she was [transformed](https://www.levelup.com/en/news/774759/Former-Microsoft-waifu-returns-and-you-can-invite-her-on-dates-in-this-game) into a new identity known as [Hoshi Hikaru](https://twitter.com/Iam_HoshiHikaru). This project's branding inspiration was specificaly derrived from the former identity instead of the new one.</sup>
